### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Josh Kraft. Welcome to my Github.

**A quick note** - please do not consider this site to be a portfolio. I do not aim to keep a clean, sleek, well organized Github profile. Instead, I use Github as a personal dumping ground. 

Idea for a project? *Create a repo*.

Want to learn something? *Create a repo*. 

Got some messy code that is a bit embarassing? *Leave it up*. 

One day I may comb through my Github and hide the mess. But for now, nothing on this profile is a finished product. For a more curated list of projects, head on over to my website, **[joshkraft.org](www.joshkraft.org)**. Thanks!
